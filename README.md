# hangman-js-game

A word game built on modern JavaScript. 
You can also test it here https://vladel-hangman.netlify.app/.
A random word is loaded from an external API. Using the "keypress" event, you can type letters from your keyboard, trying to guess the word/s. 
You can fail 5 times only to stay into the game. 

The project uses ES6 with classes, modules, async/await, localStorage and webpack. 



To run the project on local machine:
- Install npm modules using: "npm install"
- Run "npm run dev-server"
